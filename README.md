Bessel Chain is a peer-to-peer decentralized network system that built upon a distributed Internet protocol. It enables secure, instant and nearly free financial transactions of tokens across the Internet. The tokens can represent currency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or gift coupons. It provides real-time assets(Tum) settlement solution that is the mirror of real world.


Bessel Chain has three basic elements: account, assets and transaction. Everyone can have accounts and hold resources, with this condition people can make assets transaction, and Bessel Chain ensures all transaction effect. From assets transaction, Bessel Chain concludes payment, book offer, assets finder, assets convert, and relation settlement transaction. With these transaction types, people can make assets flow freely.
